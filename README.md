# Où sont les femmes ?
## Description
“Où sont les femmes ?” is an university project that I am working on as part of my second semester in my Computer Science Master at the University of Lille 1.
The project aims to provide tools for sociological studies about women in scientific fields and how often they are quoted in newspapers and magazines.
My work on this project consists in writing algorithms to identify female first names in a database, and group magazine and newspaper by names.
